# text-to-binary-and-binary-to-text
This program allows users to encode text into binary or decode binary back into text, providing a simple tool for text-binary conversion. Upon running the program, users are presented with a menu to choose between "Code" or "Decode" operations. The **"Code"** option converts each character in a user-provided sentence into its binary equivalent using ASCII values. The **"Decode"** option reverses the process, converting a binary input back into readable text. The program also validates binary input to ensure proper decoding. This interactive tool is a great example of basic encoding/decoding concepts and binary manipulation in Python.
